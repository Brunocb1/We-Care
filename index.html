            <h2>About Your Pet</h2>
            <p>A domestic animal is like a child. He may not require less care and much less expense than a child
                (remember the studies, hotel, diapers and gifts for birthdays and children's days), but even so, he
                deserves all the attention possible to have a quality of life and be able to accompany his owner for
                many years.

                As much as it is a responsibility, taking care of domestic animals is not as difficult as you think.
                Expenses are relatively low if you manage to keep your pet healthy. You can also give the animal quality
                of life and still provide happiness, just with simple and cheap measures.
